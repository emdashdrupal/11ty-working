# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the Docker deployment issues with PrivateGPT on a local Kubuntu machine. The user has experienced port conflicts, container health check failures, and deployment artifacts from previous failed attempts. The goal is to create a clean, working Docker environment for PrivateGPT that can be reliably started and stopped without conflicts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up existing Docker artifacts and port conflicts, so that I can start fresh with my PrivateGPT deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the cleanup process THEN the system SHALL remove all existing PrivateGPT containers
2. WHEN I run the cleanup process THEN the system SHALL remove all existing PrivateGPT images
3. WHEN I run the cleanup process THEN the system SHALL remove all existing PrivateGPT volumes
4. WHEN I run the cleanup process THEN the system SHALL remove all existing PrivateGPT networks
5. WHEN I check for port conflicts THEN the system SHALL identify any processes using the required ports
6. WHEN I run the cleanup process THEN the system SHALL free up any conflicting ports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate my Docker Compose configuration, so that I can ensure it will work correctly before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I validate the Docker Compose file THEN the system SHALL check for syntax errors
2. WHEN I validate the Docker Compose file THEN the system SHALL verify all required environment variables are defined
3. WHEN I validate the Docker Compose file THEN the system SHALL check for port conflicts between services
4. WHEN I validate the Docker Compose file THEN the system SHALL verify all volume paths exist or can be created
5. WHEN I validate the Docker Compose file THEN the system SHALL check that all referenced Docker images are available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix container health check issues, so that all services start successfully and remain healthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a container starts THEN the system SHALL wait for dependencies to be healthy before starting dependent services
2. WHEN a health check runs THEN the system SHALL use appropriate timeouts and retry counts
3. WHEN a health check fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging
4. WHEN all containers are running THEN the system SHALL report all services as healthy
5. WHEN I check service status THEN the system SHALL show which specific health checks are failing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy PrivateGPT with the correct profile, so that I can run it in my preferred mode (CPU, GPU, or API).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I specify a profile THEN the system SHALL start only the services required for that profile
2. WHEN I use the ollama-cpu profile THEN the system SHALL start ollama-cpu, ollama proxy, and private-gpt-ollama-eduard services
3. WHEN I use the llamacpp-cpu profile THEN the system SHALL start only the private-gpt-llamacpp-cpu service
4. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL ensure proper service dependencies are met
5. WHEN I access the application THEN the system SHALL be available on the correct ports without conflicts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify my PrivateGPT deployment is working correctly, so that I can use it for my AI tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all containers are running THEN the system SHALL respond to health check endpoints
2. WHEN I access the web interface THEN the system SHALL load the PrivateGPT UI successfully
3. WHEN I test basic functionality THEN the system SHALL be able to process simple queries
4. WHEN I check logs THEN the system SHALL show no critical errors
5. WHEN I restart the deployment THEN the system SHALL come back up cleanly without manual intervention
