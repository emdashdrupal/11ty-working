        <p>Hi, I'm Ed Marsh. I'm a technical writer, information architect, and content strategist. I help organizations create and manage content that is clear, concise, and consistent. I also help organizations move from a traditional CMS to a static site generator (SSG) to improve performance, security, and cost.</p>
