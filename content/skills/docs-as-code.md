If you're writing developer-focused (or -generated) content, there's a good chance you're working in a docs-as-code environment. Docs-as-code typically uses these tools to auto-generate documentation:

- Some sort of version control, like GitLab, GitHub, or BitBucket.
- A text-based, unstructured language like Markdown, AsciiDoc, or reStructuredText. These languages are easy to learn, easy to write, and are extremely portable. The downsides are often a lack of structure and governance.
- Conversion to HTML and display in a browser. This can be roll-your-own, or incorporated into various services like a CMS, GitHub Pages, [static site generators](../static-site-transformation/), or other processors.

Agile is a software development methodology that features working on small tasks and deploying frequently. I have extensive experience with Jira and Agile:

- Defined user story guidelines that were adopted division-wide within three months of onboarding.
- Wrote user stories and epics following [Gherkin language principles](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/).
- Worked with Kanban and story boards.
