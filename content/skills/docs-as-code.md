If you're writing developer-focused (or generated) content, there's a good chance you're working in a docs-as-code environment. Docs-as-code typically uses these tools to auto-generate documentation:

- Some sort of version control, like GitLab, GitHub, or BitBucket.
- A simple text, unstructured writing language like Markdown, AsciiDoc, or reStructuredText. These languages are easy to learn, easy to write, and are extremely portable. The downside is often a lack of structure or governance.
- Conversion to HTML and display in a browser. This can be roll-your-own, or incorporated into various services like a CMS, GitHub Pages, or other processors.
