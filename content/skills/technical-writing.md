- **Detective**: Tracking down information across wikis, SharePoint, Confluence, legacy systems, and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
- **Librarian**: Knowing what information is available, what information users *actually* need, and where to find it.
- **Translator**: Tech writers interact with a bunch of folks with differing commands of the English language, as well as those whose priority or focus isn't on the writing. We get it, we're all busy. That's where tech writers and editors come in.

## Strategic content leadership

- Transform complex technical information into clear, user-focused documentation.
- Implement data-driven content strategies that align with business objectives.
- Build and maintain robust content governance frameworks.
- Design scalable information architectures that grow with your organization.
