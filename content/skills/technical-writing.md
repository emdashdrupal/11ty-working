- **Detective**: Tracking down information across wikis, SharePoint, Confluence, legacy systems, and Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
- **Librarian**: Knowing what information is available, what information users *actually* need, and where to find it.
- **Translator**: Tech writers interact with a bunch of folks with differing commands of the English language, as well as those whose priority or focus isn't on the writing. We get it, we're all busy. That's where tech writers and editors come in.

## Transforming technical communication for modern organizations

30+ years of experience means I've touched on all aspects of technical communication. My approach helps organizations not just create documentation, but build sustainable content ecosystems that drive user engagement and support business growth.

I've created:

- API reference documentation
- Cheat sheets
- eLearning modules
- Multimedia
- Online help
- PDF documentation
- Podcasts
- Printed manuals
- Technical illustrations

## Strategic content leadership

- Transform complex technical information into clear, user-focused documentation.
- Implement data-driven [content strategies](/skills/content-strategy/) that align with business objectives.
- Build and maintain robust content governance frameworks.
- Design a scalable [information architecture](/skills/information-architecture) that grows with your organization.
- Associate Fellow, Society for Technical Communication (STC).
