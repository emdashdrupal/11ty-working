I find out how your content is performing so you report, plan, and ensure the content you create is relevant and highly used topics are addressed.

## Examples

- Set up custom Kibana dashboards.
- Created custom quarterly reports that displayed metrics analysis for senior management.
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze actual performance of legacy help system, which informed migration to a new platform.
