I have extensive experience implementing and monitoring content metrics so you can:

- Plan
- Ensure the content you create is relevant
- Address highly used topics
- Identify gaps
- Report

## Examples

- Set up custom Kibana dashboards.
- Created newsletters that highlighted metrics, featured content, and relevant content for each reporting period.
- Initiated custom quarterly reports that displayed metrics analysis for senior management.
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze actual performance of legacy help system, which informed migration to a new platform.
