## Examples

- Set up custom [Elastic Kibana dashboards](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/kibana-dashboard) to monitor content quality and traffic.
- Designed and wrote division-wide email newsletter blasts highlighting metrics, featured content, and relevant content for each quarterly reporting period. Metrics indicated these blasts drove traffic to featured topics.
- Initiated custom quarterly reports that displayed metrics analysis for senior management.
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze actual performance of a legacy help system, which informed migration to a new platform.
