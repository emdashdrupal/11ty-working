Here's how I've used code to solve content problems:

- Created my first website in the 1990s.
- Wrote SQL queries to analyze hidden [user metrics](/skills/metrics/) in a legacy help system.
- Converted a 1500-topic Adobe RoboHelp project to DITA XML.
- Developed custom XSLT transforms for DITA-to-HTML conversion.
- Built a unique publishing platform using Atlassian Confluence as a CMS with a custom front end.
- Created a Python script to help subject matter experts (SMEs) auto-fill homepage metadata.
- Automated repetitive team tasks through custom scripting.
- Designed and built [contentcontent.info](https://web.archive.org/web/20210121085031/http://contentcontent.info/) &mdash; a decade-long technical content aggregator &mdash; using Drupal CMS.
- Helped establish the Drupal CMS Northern NJ user group as a founding member.
- Built edmarsh.com from scratch using WordPress in 2008.
- Transformed edmarsh.com to [run on a static site generator](/static-site-transformation/) in 2025.

## Agile and Jira

Agile is a software development methodology that features working on small tasks and deploying frequently. I have extensive experience with Jira and Agile:

- Defined user story guidelines that were adopted division-wide within three months of onboarding.
- Wrote user stories and epics following [Gherkin language principles](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/).
- Worked with Kanban and story boards.
