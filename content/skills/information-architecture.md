Giving structure to your organization's content ensures:

- Consistency across every piece and channel.
- Makes it easier to manipulate programmatically.
- Improves SEO. Provides a consistent experience.
- Lets people get the answers they need quickly to move on with their day.

## Structured authoring

Not every organization needs a rigid structure, but every organization's content needs structure. I can help you apply these principles to your content.

While not a replacement for proper information architecture, a highly structured authoring option is [DITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture), an XML-based structured authoring language for technical documentation. DITA's strength is in content reuse. Through a Component Content Management Systems (CCMS), your authors can use content as components, just as your developers use components. Its extensive use of attributes and metadata makes your technical content more available programmatically, and allows your authors to enforce writing standards across your organization.

## Examples

- Converted a 1500-topic Adobe RoboHelp project to DITA XML.
- Wrote XSLT code to customize the DITA output to HTML.
- Created a unique publishing platform, using Atlassian Confluence as a content management system (CMS) with a custom front end.
