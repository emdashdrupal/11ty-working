The way your content is presented and organized says a lot about how your company prioritizes it. Giving structure to your organization's content ensures:

- Your business' reputation is maintained by high-quality content.
- Consistency across every piece and channel.
- Makes it easier to manipulate programmatically.
- Improves SEO.
- Provides a consistent experience to your users and staff.
- Lets people get the answers they need quickly to move on with their day.

## Structured authoring

Once you determine your architecture, you need a way to govern it. [DITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture) is an XML-based structured authoring language for technical documentation. DITA's strength is in:

- Enforcing structure
- Using an attribute-based
- Content reuse.

Through a Component Content Management Systems (CCMS), your authors can use content as components, just as your developers use components. Its extensive use of attributes and metadata makes your technical content more available programmatically, and allows your authors to enforce writing standards across your organization.
