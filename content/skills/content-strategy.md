Let's be honest. Most organizations' content is scattered across Confluence pages, SharePoint, your company's intranet, hundreds of repositories, help systems which may or may not be current, knowledge management systems, Word documents, and more.

Content strategy means the right content in the right format at the right time in the right place. Do you really want to "throw AI" at it without understanding the complexity and the true costs?


The best place to start is with a content audit. I *love* content audits. Let me help you and show you how to:

- Understand what content assets you have, where they are, and the formats they're in.
- Use [metrics](/skills/metrics/) to guide your strategy.
- Define a common language through a style guide.
- Define structure through [information architecture](/skills/information-architecture/).
- Govern and maintain your content.

## Governance

Content without governance is an organizational nightmare: unsustainable, and impossible to maintain.

The content your organization generates needs a goal, organization, style, and governance. Without someone setting content standards and monitoring its performance:

- Your content becomes disorganized and strewn across multiple platforms.
- Content duplication makes it impossible for your employees, clients, and users to find the single source of truth.
- Productivity declines because your employees are searching multiple places.

Here's a free, [two-page checklist](/assets/pdfs/website-review-checklist.pdf) to ensure your site's content is best portraying your company's best side. [Contact me](/contact/) if you want to learn more!

## Examples

- Managed and coordinated product content strategy for 35+ products with stakeholders including senior management.
- Ensured content quality by implementing style guide and documentation linter with custom business rules that improved consistency across all products.
- Identified user and organizational knowledge needs by conducting user research in formal interviews, informal conversations, focus groups, analytics research, and support ticket analysis.
