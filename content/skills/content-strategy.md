Let's be honest. Most organizations' content is scattered across Confluence pages, SharePoint, your company's intranet, hundreds of repositories, help systems which may or may not be current, knowledge management systems, Word documents, and more.

Content strategy means the right content in the right format at the right time in the right place. Do you really want to "throw AI" at it without understanding the complexity and the true costs?

The best place to start is with a content audit. I *love* content audits. Let me help you and show you how to:

- Understand what content assets you have, where they are, and the formats they're in.
- Use [data/metrics](/skills/metrics/) to guide your strategy.
- Define a common language.
- Define structure through [information architecture](/skills/information-architecture).
- Govern and maintain your content.

## Governance

Content without governance is an organizational nightmare: unsustainable, and impossible to maintain.

All the content you generate needs a goal, organization, style, and governance. Without someone setting standards and monitoring your content, your knowledge base, wiki, help portal, or Confluence instance becomes a Wild West of content. With everyone in your org contributing and duplicating content, it makes it impossible for your employees and users to find the single source of truth.
