Let's be honest. Most organizations' content is scattered across Confluence pages, SharePoint, your company's internal wiki, hundreds of repositories, help systems which may or may not be current, knowledge management systems, Word documents, and more. Do you really just want to "throw AI" at it without understanding the complexity and the true costs?

Where do you start? With a content audit. Let me help you and show you how.

- Use [data/metrics](/skills/metrics) to guide your strategy.
- Define a common language.
- Define structure.

## Governance

Content without governance is an organizational nightmare, unsustainable, and impossible to maintain.

All the content your company generates needs a goal, organization, style, and governance. Without someone setting standards and monitoring your content, your knowledge base, wiki, help portal, or Confluence instance becomes a Wild West of content. With everyone in your org contributing and duplicating content, it makes it impossible for your employees and users to find the single source of truth.
