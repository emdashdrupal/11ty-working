I have a history of finding those people and encouraging them to be champions for high-quality content that's an asset to your firm.

## Stakeholder management

I have a long track record successfully interacting with:

- Product managers
- Business analysts
- Senior management
- Cross-divisional leadership
- The Executive Office
- Internal Audit
- Support teams
- End users
- Developers

## How I've built community

- Held quarterly "content champions" meetings with interested stakeholders to get their feedback on how our content and site are performing, and workshop upcoming content initiatives.
- Started a regular "content creators catchup" that brought cross-divisional tech writers, UXers, and others involved with content across the firm together to share and learn.
- Created custom monthly metric emails to let stakeholders know how their content is performing, and where there may be gaps or opportunities.
- Spoken at user groups and conferences.
- Created a [pioneering podcast](/podcasts/) to give back to the technical writing community.
