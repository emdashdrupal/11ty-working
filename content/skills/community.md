I have a history of finding those people and encouraging them to be champions for high-quality technical content that's an asset to your firm.

## How I've built community

- Held quarterly "content champions" meetings with interested stakeholders to get their feedback on how our content and site are performing, and bounce upcoming content ideas off of them.
- Started a regular "content creators catchup" that brought cross-divisional tech writers, UXers, and others involved with content across the firm together to share and learn.
- Created custom monthly metric emails to let stakeholders know how their content is performing, and where there may be gaps or opportunities.
- Spoken at [user groups and conferences](public-speaking/).
- Created a podcast dedicated to giving back to the [technical writing community](/content/podcasts/).
