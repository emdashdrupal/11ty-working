In my experience, there are documentation advocates in every organization. They're often few and far between, but when you find them, you make them your advocates, your sounding board, and your champions.

- I've held quarterly "content champions" meetings with interested stakeholders to get their feedback on how our content and site are performing, and bounce upcoming content ideas off of them.
- I started a regular "content creators catchup" that brought cross-divisional tech writers, UXers, and other folks involved with content together to share and learn from each other.
- Created custom monthly metric emails to let stakeholders know how their content is performing, and where there may be gaps or opportunities.
- I've attended and [spoken at user groups](public-speaking.md) and conferences around the US.
