Working in just HTML and CSS was invigorating because I'd done it since the 1990s. There was something simple, pure, and frankly *nostalgic* about it.

Working with a static site generator indirectly made *writing* fun again (note I'm writing this sentence two weeks into the new year). To be able to update stuff, and have something not work-related (well, someone else's work) to write about, in such a simple format as Markdown, felt really good, and rapid changes were easy.

I didn't need a reminder about the importance of structure, metadata, reuse, and strategy, but it all felt natural &mdash; almost like I've done it for over 30 years.

Trying to work with documentation for several different pieces of software reminds me that yes, I too hate to RTFM. But there is a difference between good docs and bad docs, and it's obvious. There is lots of opportunities for technical writers to improve developer documentation &mdash; if businesses are willing to pay for it. In my experience, they're often not until it's too late.

## Accessibility

The other nice thing about creating sites from HTML is that you can control how it's generated, and be sure to use the built-in elements to make my site accessible.

## Final thoughts

Like any project, learning and implementing is a process. I often think I can skip steps in the process, especially when one of my end goals for this project is to promote myself while looking for a job. You can tell the early writing of these pages by the sheer amount of frustration in my (written) voice.
