title: When your content strategy goes wrong
description: Writing this blog post wasn't part of my plan.

A major part of my content strategy for this site was releasing blog posts on a regular cadence to drive traffic. As I updated my site, I documented the process through partially written Markdown files. I stored these stubs in a DON'T DELETE branch in my Git repository. Not quite best practice, but also not unusual to those who have had to clean up obsolete branches.

When it came time to pull one out of that branch, I decided the content reuse piece seemed to make sense. It followed an [AI-related post](/static-site-transformation/writing-with-ai) that was widely viewed (surprise!).

I published the post, and felt good about where I'd taken it. I saw some traffic dribble in. Not surprisingly, the AI post was a bigger draw than content reuse.

&hellip;Then I noticed I'd already [used a large portion of that content](/static-site-transformation/the-how). Ironically, my blog post about reusing content duplicated my own content.

## Test case

Once I discovered the mistake a few days later, I left both up for a couple of weeks. Either no one noticed or no one notified me. Based on my Google Analytics, It seems to be the former.

## Lessons learned

In this case, no harm, no foul. I had a chance to fix things that no one noticed. I merged the new relevant edits into the existing file.

Posting regular blog posts is doing what I expected: driving eyeballs. But based on metrics, it's a one-and-done. I'm a believer in Mark Baker's book *Every Page is Page One*, and in this case, it actually seems to be true: each blog post is a piece of content unto itself, regardless of duplication.

This is a luxury you *don't* have when you publish professional content at scale. In many cases, this would be picked up in a pull request (PR) review or edit, but not always.
