title: When your content strategy goes wrong
description: Ironically, my blog about reusing content duplicated my own content.

A major part of my content strategy for this site was to release blog posts on a regular cadence to drive traffic. As I updated my site, I documented the process through partially written Markdown files. I stored this in a DON'T DELETE branch in my Git repository.

When it came time to pull one out of that branch, I decided the content reuse piece seemed to make sense after my AI post that was widely viewed.

I published the post, and felt good about where I'd taken it. Then I saw some traffic dribble in. Not surprisingly, the AI post was a bigger draw than content reuse.

Then I went back to my existing published content and saw that I'd already [used a large portion of that content](/static-site-transformation/content-strategy-for-ssgs).

## Test case

Once I discovered the mistake a few days later, I left both up for a couple of weeks. Either no one noticed or no one notified me. Based on my Google Analytics, It seems to be the former.

## Lessons learned

In this case, no harm, no foul. I had a chance to fix things that no one noticed. I merged the new relevant edits into the existing file.

This is a luxury you *don't* have when you publish professional content at scale. In many cases, this would be picked up in a pull request (PR) review or edit, but not always.
