title: When your content strategy goes wrong
description: Ironically, my blog about reusing content actually duplicated my own content.

The major part of my content strategy for this site was to release blog posts in drips to drive traffic. I documented as I went through the process of updating my site, and had many half-written (or less) posts to draw from.

When it came time to pull one out of that branch, one on content reuse seemed to make sense, following up on my AI post that was widely received.

I finished up the post, and I felt pretty good about where I'd taken it. I published it, promoted it on LinkedIn, and saw some traffic dribble in. Not surprisingly, AI was a bigger draw than content reuse.

And then I went back to my existing published content and saw that I'd pretty much already [used a large portion of that content already](/static-site-transformation/content-strategy-for-ssgs.md).

## Solution

I left both up for a couple of weeks. Either no one noticed or no one notified me. Based on my stats, I'm guessing it's the former. This gave me a chance to fix things that few people may have noticed, which is a luxury you *don't* have when you publish content at scale. In this case, no harm, no foul.
