## Determining personas

The first question of technical writing is *who is the user*? The users you identify inform and guide your content strategy. In my case, my users include:

- Potential employers.
- Technical writers&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;both experienced and new.
- Listeners (and potential listeners) of my podcast.
- Those who want to learn about static site generators (SSGs) and/or docs-as-code.

## Content goals

- Highlight my skills to attract employers, and also as a thought experiment&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;what *do* I do?
- Create a [series of blog posts](#blog-release-strategy) documenting my migration experience from WordPress to a static site generator.
- Highlight my podcast, as the old site really didn't. I'm also considering reviving the podcast so this is high-priority
- Get rid of legacy content.
- Ensure the site is accessible.

### Blog release strategy

My strategy for documenting the conversion from WordPress to a static site generator (SSG) included:

- Write 10-20 blog posts about the process, including:
  - Migration
  - Strategy
  - Infrastructure
  - Build-out
  - Frustrations
  - Development
  - Content creation and revision processes
  - Takeaways
- Write four solid blog posts for the rollout.
- Put that content out on a regular cadence to keep content fresh and drive continuous engagement.
- Inspire tech writers to get more technical.
- Understand and explain how content is consumed programmatically.
- Show recruiters and employers that I was actively updating my site.
