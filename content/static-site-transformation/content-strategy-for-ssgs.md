Structuring, planning, and maintaining content is critical.



## Who are my users?

The first question of technical writing is *who is the user*? The users you identify inform and guide your content strategy. In my case, my users include:

- Potential employers.
- Technical writers &mdash; both experienced and new.
- Listeners (and potential listeners) of my podcast.
- Those who want to learn about static site generators (SSGs) and/or docs-as-code.

## Content goals

- Highlight my skills to attract employers.
- Create a series of blog posts about my experience migrating from WordPress to a static site generator.
- Highlight my podcast, as the old site really didn't. I'm also considering reviving the podcast so this is high-priority
- Get rid of legacy content.
- Ensure the site is accessible.

### Blogging strategy

My content strategy for the conversion from WordPress to a static site generator (SSG) included:

- Blogging about the entire conversion, somewhere between 10-20 posts. This includes the migration, the build-out, and the content creation and revision processes along the way.
- Put that content out on a regular cadence to keep content fresh and drive continuous engagement.
- Inspire tech writers to get more technical.
- Understand and explain how content is consumed programmatically.

#### Publishing cadence for the SSG series

As part of my site rollout, I wanted to have four solid blog posts ready on debut, with the plan to roll out the others &mdash; in either small batches or individually &mdash; to keep traffic coming to my site, and to show recruiters and employers that I was still actively updating my site and the series.

## Information architecture

My initial site architecture was based on the existing architecture in WordPress:

- Home: promotes posts across all of the content types &mdash; podcast, writing samples, skills, and this SSG series.
- About
- Skills: List of the ways I can help a potential client/employer
- Tech writing examples: gallery page
- Speaking engagements/presentations: gallery page
- Blog (etc): gallery page
- Podcast pages: gallery page
- A sidebar that displays a tag cloud
- Photo galleries (?)
- Contact
- Resume(?)

Very few parts of this structure ended up in version 1.0 of the site. If you've ever revamped lots of legacy content, this probably isn't surprising.

### Content types

I created three main content types (page types):

- **Homepage**: Intro and a headshot, and galleries of the four most important, or recent, items that have been updated in three categories: podcasts, skills, and this series of blog posts.
- **Grid pages**: Overview pages that list each of my skills, blog posts, and podcast episodes.
- **Details pages**: For each of the categories:
  - Blog posts,
  - Podcast episodes,including show notes and an episode player.
  - More information about each of my skills, the relevant tools used, and any relation presentations or publications I've created.
### Content reuse

Using metadata and collections enables reuse. Copy-pasted content across pages is a maintenance nightmare. Someone has to remember to update it, and also *all the places* where the content is pasted.

As I built out the site, I wanted to re-use the first sentence of each details page to display as descriptions on the cards on the grid pages. This also allowed me to style the descriptions separately.
