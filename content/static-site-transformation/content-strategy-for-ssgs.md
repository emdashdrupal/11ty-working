Structuring, planning, and maintaining content is critical.

## Who are my users?

The first question of technical writing is *who is the user*? The users you identify inform and guide your content strategy. In my case, my users include:

- Potential employers.
- Technical writers &mdash; both experienced and new.
- Listeners (and potential listeners) of my podcast.
- Those who want to learn about static site generators (SSGs) and/or docs-as-code.

## Content goals

- Highlight my skills to attract employers.
- Create a series of blog posts about my experience migrating from WordPress to a static site generator.
- Highlight my podcast, as the old site really didn't. I'm also considering reviving the podcast so this is high-priority
- Get rid of legacy content.
- Ensure the site is accessible.

### Blogging strategy

My content strategy for the conversion from WordPress to a static site generator (SSG) included:

- Blogging about the entire conversion, somewhere between 10-20 posts. This includes the migration, the build-out, and the content creation and revision processes along the way.
- Put that content out on a regular cadence to keep content fresh and drive continuous engagement.
- Inspire tech writers to get more technical.
- Understand and explain how content is consumed programmatically.

#### Publishing cadence for the SSG series

As part of my site rollout, I wanted to have four solid blog posts ready on debut, with the plan to roll out the others &mdash; in either small batches or individually &mdash; to keep traffic coming to my site, and to show recruiters and employers that I was still actively updating my site and the series.
