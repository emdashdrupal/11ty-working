Why is this forking shirtballs so hard? [Read this](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/) and tell me how you're supposed to make a working navigation system with drop-down menus.

Ultimately I didn't use the built-in navigation features because I couldn't make heads or tails of it, and it was far easier to have AI help me with the logic of the code and drop-downs.
