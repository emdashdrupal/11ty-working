Frankly, it was strategic. My contract ended at the end of 2024. I needed a job. To get a job, you need writing samples. Mine were woefully out of date, as was my WordPress site.

It was an opportunity to review 15 years' worth of content, get rid of some cruft, reduce my hosting costs, learn some things, and put together a portfolio.

The content strategy was to blog about the process, and to put that content out on a regular cadence to draw traffic. I also hope to inspire other tech writers to get more technical, and understand how the content we create is consumed programmatically.

## Goals

Ultimately, my goal was to:

- Quickly revamp my website to enhance my chances at getting hired.
- Update a 10-year-old website.
- Reduce hosting costs.
- Reduce the overhead of maintaining a content management system. I haven't blogged in some time, and my podcast has been on hiatus since 2022.
- Add value by developing with SSGs. This isn't a skill a lot of technical writers have.
- Understand how to structure content not only for SSGs, but other programmatic use.
- Review all the content on my site and see if and how it's promoting my career in the best light.
- Learn newer technologies (that [leverage old ones like HTML and CSS](../creating-templates))!
- Have a steady stream of blog content that I can drive traffic to and show as writing samples.
- Enjoy writing again.
- Do something for *me*.

## The what

Turns out, when you decide to build a website from scratch, even with an SSG, that you're building it from *scratch*. Sure there are starter themes and frameworks, but everyone's use case is different. In my case, I ended up with three main content types:

- The homepage, which gives my intro and a headshot, then galleries of the four most important, or recent, items that have been updated.
- Grid pages, which drill down into things like skills, blog posts, and my podcast episodes.
- Details pages, which are the landing pages for each podcast episode, and the meat of the other content pages.
