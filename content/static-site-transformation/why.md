Frankly, it was strategic. My contract ended at the end of 2024. I needed a job. To get a job, you need writing samples. Mine were woefully out of date, as was my WordPress site. I didn't realize *just* how out of date it was until I got deep into this project.

It was an opportunity to review 15 years' worth of content, get rid of some cruft, reduce my hosting costs, learn some things, and put together a portfolio.

The content strategy was to blog about the process, and to put that content out on a regular cadence to draw traffic. I also hope to inspire other tech writers to get more technical, and understand how the content we create is consumed programmatically.

## Goals

My goal were to:

- Quickly revamp my website to enhance my chances at getting hired.
- Update a 10-year-old website.
- Reduce hosting costs.
- Reduce the overhead of maintaining a content management system. I haven't blogged in some time, and my podcast has been on hiatus since 2022.
- Archive old content like those early days of blog posts.
- Add value by developing with SSGs. This isn't a skill a lot of technical writers have.
- Understand how to structure content not only for SSGs, but other programmatic use.
- Review all the content on my site and see if and how it's promoting my career in the best light.
- Learn newer technologies (that [leverage old ones like HTML and CSS](../creating-templates))!
- Have a steady stream of blog content that I can drive traffic to and show as writing samples.
- Enjoy writing again.
- Do something for *me*.

## My use case

Here are my initial structure thoughts that changed as I built things out:

- Home - promotes posts across all of the content types &mdash; podcast, writing samples, skills, and this SSG series.
- About
- List of skills of all the ways I can help a potential client/employer
- Podcast
- Tech writing examples - gallery page
- Speaking engagements/presentations
- Blog (etc) - gallery page
- Podcast pages  - gallery page
- A sidebar that displays a tag cloud
- photo galleries (?)
- Contact
- Resume(?)

Most of them ended up in the finished product. Some I may include after I publish version 1.0. I intend to keep this site more updated than the last one (!remindme 1 year), but I wanted it to be as feature-complete as possible on publish day.

## The what

I've played around with static site generators, and in a prior role our output went through a heavily customized version of [Gatsby](https://gatsby.js), though I wasn't hands-on with it. It made sense to me to build the site with an SSG because it's fast, and relevant to what we do as technical communicators.

I quickly learned that when you decide to build a website from scratch, even with an SSG, you're building it from *scratch*. There are starter themes and frameworks, but I figured I had the time and inclination to learn some newer tech and play the role of a developer while revamping the content and content strategy of my site.

the problem ended up being i wanted to play with all the toys and build the site, and the focus on the content came last. This explains so much why a content-first approach is so often ignored by developers.
