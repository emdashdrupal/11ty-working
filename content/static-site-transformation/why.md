Frankly, it was strategic. My contract ended at the end of 2024. I needed a job. To get a job, you need writing samples. Mine were woefully out of date, as was my WordPress site.

It was an opportunity to review 15 years' worth of content, get rid of some cruft, reduce my hosting costs, learn some things, and put together a portfolio.

The content strategy was to blog about the process, and to put that content out on a regular cadence to draw traffic. I also hope to inspire other tech writers to get more technical, and understand how the content we create is consumed programmatically.

## what's my goal?

Blog about the experience

Ultimately, my goal was to:

- Update a 10-year-old website.
- Reduce costs.
- Add value by developing with SSGs. This isn't a skill a lot of technical writers have.
- Understand as a technical writer how to structure content for SSGs.
- Learn newer technologies (that leverage old ones like HTML and CSS!).
- Have a steady stream of blog content that I can drive traffic to and show as writing samples.
- Enjoy writing again.
- Do something for *me*.
