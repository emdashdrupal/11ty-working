Frankly, it was strategic. My contract ended at the end of 2024. I needed a job. To get a job, you need writing samples. Of course, I don't have any recent samples due to intellectual property (IP) laws, which I take seriously. The public-facing samples I *did* write were woefully out-of-date, as was my WordPress site. I didn't realize *just* how out-of-date the site was until I got deep into this project.

This was that rare opportunity to review 15 years' worth of content, get rid of cruft, reduce my hosting costs, learn some things, and update my portfolio.

## Technical goals

- Update a 10-year-old design.
- Retire a complex WordPress site that didn't get much traffic and needed maintenance.
- Quickly ("quickly") revamp my website to increase my chances at getting hired.
- Add value by developing with SSGs, which isn't a skill a lot of technical writers have.
- Learn newer technologies (that [leverage old ones like HTML and CSS](../creating-templates)).

## Content goals

- Have a steady stream of blog content that I can drive traffic to and show as writing samples.
- Review all the content on my site and see if and how it's promoting my career in the best light.
- Decide whether to archive old content, like those *very* early blog posts.
- Understand how to structure content not only for SSGs, but other programmatic use.
- Enjoy writing again.
- Do something for *me*.

## Cost goals

Financial and personal/time costs:

- Reduce the overhead of maintaining a content management system. I haven't blogged in some time, and my podcast has been on hiatus since 2022 (stay tuned&hellip;). Maintenance included all of the plugins I used, as well as WordPress itself. On top of that, hundreds of spam comments came through every day that had to be deleted.
- Reduce hosting costs. SSGs can be hosted in many places that WordPress sites can't, which gave me flexibility to move to a zero- or low-cost host. That doesn't mean there are zero costs to hosting the site; my site host was also my mail server, so I had to find and set up an alternative (and my first choice was too difficult to set up). Getting rid of an annual hosting fee allowed me to allocate those resources elsewhere &mdash; such as mail and podcast hosting.

## My use case

Here are my initial structure thoughts that changed as I built things out:

- Home - promotes posts across all of the content types &mdash; podcast, writing samples, skills, and this SSG series.
- About
- List of skills of all the ways I can help a potential client/employer
- Podcast
- Tech writing examples - gallery page
- Speaking engagements/presentations
- Blog (etc) - gallery page
- Podcast pages  - gallery page
- A sidebar that displays a tag cloud
- photo galleries (?)
- Contact
- Resume(?)

As I developed the site and the content, very few ended up in version 1.0. I intend to keep this site more updated than the last one (!remindme 1 year).
