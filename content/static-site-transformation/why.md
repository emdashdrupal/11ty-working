## what's my goal?

Blog about the experience

Ultimately, my goal was to:

- Update a 10-year-old website.
- Reduce costs.
- Add value by developing with SSGs. This isn't a skill a lot of technical writers have.
- Understand as a technical writer how to structure content for SSGs.
- Learn newer technologies (that leverage old ones like HTML and CSS!).
- Have a steady stream of blog content that I can drive traffic to and show as writing samples.
- Enjoy writing again.
- Do something for *me*.
