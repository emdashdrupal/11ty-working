I've always been [curious about and dabbled in software development](/skills/code-development/). I've built websites starting in 1996, including the WordPress site I built in 2008.

That site and its scope expanded when I started my podcast in 2015. When I decided to update my site, getting seriously hands-on appealed to me.

This was a rare greenfield opportunity to:

- Audit a lifetime's worth of content dating back to LiveJournal blogs.
- Get rid of cruft.
- Reduce costs.
- Update my portfolio from a clean slate.
- Understand how content is programmatically consumed and displayed to users.

Lastly, taking on this project was strategic. I don't have any recent writing samples that I could share with potential employers due to intellectual property (IP) laws, which I take seriously. The public-facing samples I *did* write were woefully out-of-date, as was my WordPress site. I didn't realize *just* how out-of-date the site was until I got deep into this project.

## Technical goals

- Update a 10-year-old design.
- Retire a complex WordPress site that didn't get much traffic and needed maintenance.
- Quickly ("quickly") revamp my website to increase my chances at getting hired.
- Add value by developing with SSGs, which isn't a skill a lot of technical writers have.
- Learn newer technologies (that leverage old ones like HTML and CSS).

## Content goals

- A steady stream of content to drive traffic and show as writing samples.
- Give back by documenting the static site implementation process.
- Review all the content on my site and see if and how it's promoting me in the best light.
- Decide whether to archive old content, like those *very* early blog posts.
- Understand how to structure content not only for SSGs, but other programmatic use.
- Enjoy writing again.
- Do something for *me*.

## Cost savings goals

This includes financial and labor savings:

- Minimize the overhead of maintaining a content management system. I no longer needed the complexity of a self-managed WordPress site. I hadn't blogged in some time, and my [podcast](/podcasts/) has been on hiatus since 2022 (stay tuned&hellip;). Maintenance included:
  - Keeping up with plugin updates.
  - WordPress updates.
  - Processing the hundreds of spam comments that came through every day.
- Reduce hosting costs. SSGs don't require heavy infrastructure such as a database, so they can be hosted in places that WordPress sites can't. This gave me flexibility to move to a zero- or low-cost host. That *doesn't* mean there are zero costs to hosting the site:
  - My existing site host was also my mail server, so I had to find and set up my own mail hosting. To add to the frustration, my first choice was too difficult to set up.
  - I had to upgrade my podcast hosting. My podcast archive puts me at the limit of free disk space and bandwidth on GitHub, so I had to offload that burden to a paid service.
  - Downsizing from a web host I'd undergrown meant I could re-allocate those resources.
  - While this solution is cheaper in long-term financial cost, the initial investment in setting up my own infrastructure, as well as the ongoing added mail server administration, may be a factor for some people.
