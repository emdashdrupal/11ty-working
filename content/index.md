<span class="text-lg font-sans font-semibold">Hi, I'm Ed Marsh</span>. I'm a technical communicator, content strategist, and community builder. I'm passionate about creating and managing technical content that's clear, concise, and consistent. I specialize in building or revamping documentation practices.


I've worked for software companies and in financial services on both user- and developer-facing documentation.


My process involves:
- Assessing your current content situation.
- Defining structure.
- Implementing content strategy.
- Engaging the people in your organization who are documentation advocates.
