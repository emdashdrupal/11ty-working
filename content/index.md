 <span class="text-xl font-semibold">Hi, I'm Ed Marsh</span>. I'm a technical communicator, content strategist, community builder, and podcaster. I'm passionate about creating and managing content that is clear, concise, and consistent. My process involves assessing your current content situation, defining structure, and implementing content strategy. As a result, your content performs better, particularly with AI and large language models (LLMs).</p>

- Adobe Creative Cloud
- Adobe RoboHelp
- Confluence
- Elasticsearch/Kibana
- Git
- Jira
