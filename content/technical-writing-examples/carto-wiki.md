I take intellectual property seriously since I worked in a highly regulated environment. As a result, I don't have a lot of recent samples to share.



## Carto mod wiki update

[Carto](https://github.com/taipei-native/Carto) is a mod (plugin) for a city-building game I play called Cities: Skylines 2. The mod exports data from your city such as zoning, population, building type, your highway and mass transit networks, topography, and more. You can then open this data in open-source software called [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), using professional visualization tools to better understand and plan your city.

I rewrote and reorganized the [mod's wiki](https://github.com/taipei-native/Carto/wiki). You can [see the history](https://github.com/taipei-native/Carto/wiki/Home/_history) with the changes I made.
