I take intellectual property seriously since I worked in a highly regulated environment. As a result, I don't have a lot of recent samples to share.

## Cities:Skylines mod documentation

[Cities: Skylines 2](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/about) is an advanced a city-building game. Its ecosystem encourages fans of the game to create mods (plugins) to enhance the abilities of the base game. Mods often help create custom roads, lines of trees or bushes, and display city metrics. Here are two mods to which I contributed.

## Line tool lite readme update

I used this [early version of a mod](https://github.com/algernon-A/LineToolLite/pull/13) to get my feet wet in the community, and see if other modders would be interested in contributions. It's helpful when players want a line of trees alongside a building, or create a circle of bushes in a park.

## Carto mod wiki update

[Carto](https://github.com/taipei-native/Carto) exports geographical information systems (GIS) data from your city such as zoning, population, building type, highway and mass transit networks, topography, and more. You can then open this data in open-source software called [QGIS](https://qgis.org/), using professional visualization tools to better understand and plan your city.

I rewrote and reorganized the [mod's wiki](https://github.com/taipei-native/Carto/wiki). You can [see the history](https://github.com/taipei-native/Carto/wiki/Home/_history) with the changes I made.
