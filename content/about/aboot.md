I've always been curious about technology. As a kid, I was the one who pushed all the buttons to see what would happen. That curiosity led to an award-winning career in technical communication.

## Career Journey

My web journey started in the mid-1990s with my [first website](https://web.archive.org/web/19991008110914/http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/8299/frameset.html). Since then, I've evolved with technology - from self-hosting WordPress to building this site with Eleventy in 2024. This evolution reflects my commitment to understanding and documenting technology.

My career started in New York City's software industry in 1994 as a &ldquo;technical writing assistant&rdquo; (I didn't know what technical writing was at the time). I learned how to be a technical writer at Information Builders (now part of Tibco). After a stint as a solo technical writer for a financial services technical provider where I spent time on a trading floor and in data centers, I progressed to Goldman Sachs, where I advanced to Vice President as a technical writer and eLearning developer. Working in small, medium, and enterprise environments taught me crucial lessons about:

- Cross-functional collaboration
- Risk management
- Information governance
- Content strategy at scale
- Managing projects and subject matter experts

### Notable contributions

## Education Impact

- I've mentored
- As the former director of the Secaucus High School Marching Band and co-founder of the Cacophony Percussion Ensemble, I led the band to represent New Jersey in Washington DC's National July 4th Parade. In 2006, [School Band and Orchestra](http://www.sbomagazine.com/) magazine recognized me as one of "50 Directors Who Make a Difference."

## Personal

A proud New Jersey native, I'm passionate about:

- Craft beer (former homebrewer)
- Culinary experimentation
- IndyCar racing
- Web design and development
