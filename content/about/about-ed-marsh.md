A proud New Jersey native, I'm passionate about:

- Proper punctuation (especially the emdash (&mdash;), semicolon and ellipsis&hellip;).
- The Oxford comma.
- Craft beer (former homebrewer).
- Making restaurant-quality food at home with local ingredients.
- IndyCar racing.

## Career journey

My career started in New York City's software industry at Information Builders (now part of Tibco) in 1994. I learned how to be a technical writer as part of a large documentation team.

My web journey started in the mid-1990s with my [first website (archived link)](https://web.archive.org/web/19991008110914/http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/8299/frameset.html).

After a stint as a solo technical writer for a financial services SaaS provider, where I spent time on a trading floor and in data centers, I progressed to Goldman Sachs. Over 13 years, I worked in two divisions on Wall Street, creating both user- and developer-facing content. Working in small, medium, and enterprise environments taught me crucial lessons about:

- Cross-functional collaboration.
- Risk management.
- Governance.
- Content strategy at scale.
- Managing projects and subject matter experts.

Continually evolving has been a foundation of my adult life:

- Learning how to be a technical communicator.
- Learning how to teach music to middle- and high-school students.
- Learning how to write music.
- Content strategy.
- Governance.
- Project management.
- Public speaking.
- Creating my own podcast.
- And more.

## A love of learning and teaching

As a former high school drumline instructor, my goal was to get young drummers to play and sound like one through teamwork and structure, which helped me bring a structured approach to content.

- I've mentored dozens of people:
  - Former students.
  - Colleagues.
  - Children of former colleagues.
  - Numerous people on the ADPlist platform.
- I was a high school marching band instructor for 14 years, including six as director.
  - The band represented New Jersey in Washington DC's National July 4th Parade.
  - I co-founded a percussion ensemble called Cacophony, writing original scores.
  - I created and maintained the band's website starting in 1996. The band performed in an Ikea advertisement because they found our website.
  - In 2006, [School Band and Orchestra](http://www.sbomagazine.com/) magazine recognized me as one of "50 Directors Who Make a Difference", representing the state of New Jersey.
