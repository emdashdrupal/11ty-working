Even though my job title has always been *technical writer*, I've made complex information accessible for over three decades by incorporating information architecture, content strategy, and community.

As a drummer, I'm a fan of structure. As a former drumline instructor, my goal was to get several snare drummers to sound like one &mdash; through structure.

I endorse the Oxford (serial) comma.

## Career journey

My web journey started in the mid-1990s with my [first website (archived link)](https://web.archive.org/web/19991008110914/http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/8299/frameset.html). Since then, I've evolved with technology &mdash; from self-hosting WordPress to building this site with Eleventy starting in 2024. This evolution reflects my commitment to understanding and documenting technology. Continually evolving has been a foundation of my adult life &mdash; from learning how to be a technical communicator, to learning how to teach music to middle- and high-school students, to content strategy, governance, and project management.

My career started in New York City's software industry in 1994 as a "technical writing assistant". I didn't know what technical writing was at the time. I learned how to *be* a technical writer at Information Builders (now part of Tibco) as part of a large documentation team. After a stint as a solo technical writer for a financial services SaaS provider, where I spent time on a trading floor and in data centers, I progressed to Goldman Sachs. Over 13 years, I worked in two divisions, creating both user- and developer-facing content. Working in small, medium, and enterprise environments taught me crucial lessons about:

- Cross-functional collaboration.
- Risk management.
- Governance.
- Content strategy at scale.
- Managing projects and subject matter experts.
