description: I've always been curious about technology. As a kid, I was the one who pushed all the buttons to see what would happen. That curiosity led to some scolding and an award-winning career in technical communication.

Even though my job title has always been *technical writer*, I've made making complex information accessible for over three decades by incorporating information architecture, content strategy, and community.

I endorse the Oxford (serial) comma.

I was a high school marching band instructor for 14 years, including six as director. I co-founded a percussion ensemble, writing original scores.

## Career journey

My web journey started in the mid-1990s with my [first website](https://web.archive.org/web/19991008110914/http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/8299/frameset.html). Since then, I've evolved with technology &mdash; from self-hosting WordPress to building this site with Eleventy starting in 2024. This evolution reflects my commitment to understanding and documenting technology. Continually evolving has been a foundation of my adult life &mdash; from learning how to be a technical communicator, to learning how to teach music to middle- and high-school students, to content strategy, governance, and yadda yadda.

My career started in New York City's software industry in 1994 as a "technical writing assistant" (I didn't know what technical writing was at the time). I learned how to be a technical writer at Information Builders (now part of Tibco) as part of a large documentation team. After a stint as a solo technical writer for a financial services technical provider, where I spent time on a trading floor and in data centers, I progressed to Goldman Sachs. I worked in two divisions &mdash; creating both user- and developer-facing content &mdash;, and advanced to Vice President. Working in small, medium, and enterprise environments taught me crucial lessons about:

- Cross-functional collaboration
- Risk management
- Information governance
- Content strategy at scale
- Managing projects and subject matter experts
