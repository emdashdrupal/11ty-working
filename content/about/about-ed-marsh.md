I'm a proud New Jersey native, and I'm passionate about:

- Proper punctuation (especially the em dash &mdash;, semicolon, and ellipsis&hellip;).
- The Oxford comma.
- Craft beer (former homebrewer).
- Making restaurant-quality food at home with local ingredients.
- IndyCar racing.

## Career journey

My career started in New York City's software industry at Information Builders (now part of Tibco) in 1994. I learned how to be a technical writer as part of a large documentation team.

My web journey started in the mid-1990s with my [first website (archived link)](https://web.archive.org/web/19991008110914/http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Cafe/8299/frameset.html).

After a stint as a solo technical writer for a financial services SaaS provider &mdash; where I spent time on a trading floor and in data centers &mdash; I progressed to Goldman Sachs. Over 13 years, I worked in two divisions on Wall Street, creating both user- and developer-facing content. Working in small, medium, and enterprise environments taught me crucial lessons about:

- Cross-functional collaboration.
- Risk management.
- Governance.
- Content strategy at scale.
- Managing projects and subject matter experts.

Here's how I've continually evolved throughout my adult life:

- Learning how to be a technical communicator.
- Learning how to teach music to middle- and high-school students.
- Learning how to write music.
- Developing content strategy.
- Implementing governance.
- Managing projects.
- Public speaking.
- Creating my own podcast.

## A love of learning and teaching

As a former high school drumline instructor, my goal was to get young drummers playing and sounding like one through teamwork and structure &mdash; which helps me bring a structured approach to content.

I've mentored dozens of people:

- Former students.
- Colleagues.
- Children of former colleagues.
- Numerous people on the ADPlist platform.

My band leadership experience includes:

- Teaching high school marching band part-time (with a full-time job) for 14 years, including six as director.
- Representing the state of New Jersey in Washington DC's National July 4th Parade.
- Co-founding a percussion ensemble called *Cacophony*, writing original scores.
- Creating and maintaining the band's website starting in 1996 &mdash; which led to the band performing in an Ikea advertisement.
- Receiving recognition from [School Band and Orchestra](http://www.sbomagazine.com/) magazine as one of "50 Directors Who Make a Difference", representing New Jersey in 2006.
