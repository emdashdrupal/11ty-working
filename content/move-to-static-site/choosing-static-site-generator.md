- Based on experience, wanted to avoid Gatsby &mdash; too complex requires a team of devs.
- Looking for as plug and play as possible (in retrospect, ha!).
- As low-code as possible. Sure, I can play with HTML, CSS, and configuration and template files, but I didn't really have time to learn JavaScript.
- Time to market &mdash; How quickly could I publish this so it was relevant to my job search?
- Ultimately, my goal was to:
  - Update a 10-year-old website.
  - Reduce costs.
  - Add value by developing with SSGs. This isn't a skill a lot of technical writers have.
  - Understand as a technical writer how to structure content for SSGs.
  - Learn newer technologies (that leverage old ones like HTML and CSS!).
  - Have a steady stream of blog content that I can drive traffic to and show as writing samples.
  - Enjoy writing again.
  - Do something for *me*.
