- Based on experience, wanted to avoid Gatsby &mdash; too complex requires a team of devs.
- Looking for as plug and play as possible (in retrospect, ha!).
- As low-code as possible. Sure, I can play with HTML, CSS, and configuration and template files, but I didn't really have time to learn JavaScript.
- Time to market &mdash; How quickly could I publish this so it was relevant to my job search?
