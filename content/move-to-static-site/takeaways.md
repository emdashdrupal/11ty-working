Working in just HTML and CSS was invigorating because I'd done it since the 1990s. There was something simple and pure about it.

Working with a static site generator also made *writing* fun again (note I'm writing this sentence two weeks into the new year). To be able to update stuff, and have something not work-related (well, someone else's work) to write about, in such a simple format as Markdown, felt really good, and rapid changes were easy.

I didn't need a reminder about the importance of structure, metadata, reuse, and strategy, but it all felt natural &mdash; almost like I've done it for over 30 years.
