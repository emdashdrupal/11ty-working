title : "Creating a virtual development environment"
description: Working in a Linux virtual environment helped me focus and separate development from my everyday Windows environment.

- Separation from your main box.
- Free!
- Closer to the metal. Sure, you can run Linux in Windows with Windows Subsystem for Linux, but that's via command line Linux. This is far easier &mdash; and has a GUI!
- Not MacOS. This is important to me. The only Apple product I've ever owned was an iPad 3 and I hated every minute of it.
- Press **Pause** and you're done for the day.
- Trying out flavors of Linux &mdash; this is clearly an optional step. But as a long-time Linux wannabe user, I had to try different "distros" like Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and KDE Plasma. [Mint Cinnamon](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=302) was the right one to &ldquo;just work&rdquo;.
